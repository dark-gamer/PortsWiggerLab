PortsWigger Lab: Password reset poisioning via middleware 
*********************************************************

Befor going to lab:

#middleware: It typically provides a standarized way for different web application or system to communicate with each other.

Task: message queuing/data transformation(*) / authentication (*)/
	authorization(*) / error handling(*)

How middleware works at authentication and authorization? (curisity)
	
	 When a user attempts to access a protected resource, the middleware intercepts the request and checks whether the user is authorized to access the resource.
	Authentication: process of verifying the identity of a user.
	Authorization:  Process of determining wheather a user has permission to perform a specific task.

In summary, middleware can be used to handle authentication and authorization by intercepting requests, verifying the user's identity, and checking their permissions to access a resource. By using middleware, developers can implement security features in a modular and reusable way, which can help to reduce development time and improve the overall security of an application.

Password Reset Poisioning: Password reset poisoning is a type of attack that targets the password reset functionality of a web application. The goal of the attack is to compromise the security of the user's account by manipulating the password reset process

Lab Work:
	vuln: password reset poisioning.
	carlos carelessly click any links in email
	my credentials --> wiener:peter
	any email sent to this account can be read via the email client on the exploit server

step 01: RECON#
DNS Server: tools use like dig/nslookup. But now no need of it...
Click on different buttons...
View Source Code.
Basically Check login functionality.

My procedure:
	01.Find my original password reset link
	02.change host to random anything--------------------> doesn't work
	02.use X-Forwarded_Host: exploit_servre_url
	03.from log of exploit server I found the password reset token of carlos.
	04.Combine the token and my reset link and finding a valid link
	05.Set new password for Carlos and login as Carlos.
